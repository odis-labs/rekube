The main components of the project are:

- [Kubernetes API](https://odis-labs.github.io/rekube/rekube/index.html#api): The entire Kubernetes API is exposed as a ReasonML library.
- [Configuration DSL](https://odis-labs.github.io/rekube/rekube/index.html#dsl): A custom PPX (preprocessor extension) can be used to write Kubernetes declarations using a JSON-like syntax with type annotations.

Note: This project is currently unstable and unreleased.

## Quickstart

See the [rekube-starter](https://github.com/odis-labs/rekube-starter) project for a working example and detailed instructions.
